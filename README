Have you ever wanted a game engine that was based on the Elm architecture and
was designed to run on older computers? No? Well, I did it anyways.

Breadbox is an open source game engine designed to run on 3D-capable consoles
and workstations such as the Nintendo 64 and the SGI Indigo. Simply load the
source code onto a floppy disk, visit your nearest Unix workstation, and compile
the engine for your desired platform.
